1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
good evening and thank you to Jesse

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Turner and John Foshay for inviting me

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
here tonight and I thank you all for

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
coming Experiment

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
math is cultural that's not a question

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it just says let's do an experiment this

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is the scenario I'm in otavalo Ecuador

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and I don't speak Spanish and the vendor

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
doesn't speak English but I want six

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
oranges so I want everyone in the

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
audience to show me six with your

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
fingers hold them up in the air let's

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
see how you show six Wow look around see

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the variety so we have six this way and

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we have six this way and we even have

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
six this way

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
in Zulu you can put your hands down

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in Zulu six literally means take the

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
thumb in Tanzania and Western and Rwanda

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in Western Tanzania you might even see

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
six this way and I know some people had

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
this and they wondered yes I saw you a

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
okay as it turns out finger gestures are

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
very cultural in nature and if you think

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
about it counting is one of the most

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
basic things one of the most basic

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
mathematics activities that a culture

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
can do well today I'm going to talk

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
about culturally relevant pedagogy in

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
terms of mathematics right so culturally

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
relevant pedagogy teaching is a pedagogy

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that empowers students and empowers them

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
intellectually socially emotionally and

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
politically and I really like that one

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
by using cultural reference to impart

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:25,000
knowledge skills and attitudes. Culturally Relevant Pedagogy

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
first of all students come to school to

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
learn we know that but we also know as

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
educators that what students learn in

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the classroom is not all there is

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Johanna Hayes our Teacher of the Year

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and she's from Waterbury Connecticut she

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
really believes that it takes more than

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
what you do in the classroom and so I

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
agree with that and I think most

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
educators know that Gloria

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ladson-billings says culturally relevant

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
teaching has three criteria one is is

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that students have academic success so

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it's not enough for the access we need

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the attainment to that students have

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
cultural competence but let's face it we

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
are also hearing that teachers need

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
cultural competence as well and finally

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that children develop a critical

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
consciousness we have to help students

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and this is where the politically comes

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
in we have to help students understand

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and be empowered to challenge the status

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
quo lots and billions goes on to say Social Context

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that schools you sometimes often do not

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
really support culturally different

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
students because they don't provide a

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
social context for learning where

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
students can have access to the

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
knowledge and a comfortable in a

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
familiar way and we heard earlier in a

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
safe way so the question is can we teach. The Question

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
mathematics in a way that students can

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
connect to themselves and to their

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
communities and to their identity can we

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
teach in a way that empower students to

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
challenge injustice

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and most of all can we teach in a way

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that honors students and their cultural

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and their intellectual greatness there's

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a lot being said there so let's think

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
about this if we want to empower

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
students the task in our classroom have

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to change right so the current

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
curriculum we have is just not gonna do

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it oh I want to tell you about my young Real Life Stories

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
lady there so she participates in a

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Saturday STEM program and I worked with

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
a group of students there to create

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
clocks for Benjamin Banneker day and

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that particular day they were able to

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
use mathematics equations to go around

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the hands of the clock and also just to

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
show their artistic side and she of

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
course is very artistic so Geneva gay

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
says that every student has a strength

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
every student does something well and

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that's what we have to start with so

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
here are some real life stories if we

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
want to connect the students these are

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
some of the things that we could do

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
these are researchers that do that do

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
math for social justice and culturally

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
relevant math bill Tate worked with the

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
teacher to do a project with students to

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
sort of learn about their community and

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
what they wanted to do was to count the

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
number of liquor stores in their

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
neighborhood and they did that they took

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
a walk around their community and then

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
they took the bus to the suburban

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
community and they counted the number of

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
liquor stores or package stores if we

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
want to say it nicely in that

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
neighborhood and they found out to their

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
surprise that there were a lot more

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
liquor stores in their neighborhood and

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
so they wrote their City Council there's

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the politically again right so when I

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
first started teaching I I didn't know

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
about that word politically I said

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that's not my place but what I'm

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
learning is

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that it is my place and so anyway these

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
students wrote a letter to their City

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
City Council and they asked to close 13

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
liquor stores that were in 1,000 feet of

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
their school how they know that they did

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the research

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
so students are learning and they're

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
dealing with issues from their community

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and they're using math they use

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
percentages decimals and fractions to

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
make their case to the City Council and

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
they were successful somewhat not

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
totally they didn't close 13 liquor

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
stores but they were somewhat successful

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the other picture with the quilts a

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Jacqueline Leonard and her colleagues

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
worked with fourth-grade teachers in

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Philadelphia and they wanted to

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
incorporate culturally relevant teaching

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and their reading and in their math

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
classroom and so what they did was they

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
made quilts so the students were able to

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
be artistic they were able to tell the

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
story because a quote tells the story

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
about your life so they were able to

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
talk about themselves and the teacher in

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
fact learned a lot about the students

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that she didn't already know the other

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
thing is they learn area and perimeter

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
so we're still doing the math right when

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Gloria ladson-billings said we have to

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
have academic success she didn't mean we

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
were going to do culturally relevant

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
math and dumb down the math we're still

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
gonna do math that is complex that gets

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
students thinking and also that sort of

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
hit the standards whatever those might

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
be because all teachers have to think

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
about that

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the last picture shows corn rolls and I

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
had a colleague talk to me about a week

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ago and she had a math lesson that she

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
wanted to do that involved corn rolls

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and she has an african-american female

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
student in her classroom well she didn't

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
feel it was her place to just pick that

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
particular student out so she emailed

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the whole class and said do you know

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
anyone that knows how to do corn rolls

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and would they mind speaking to our

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
class low and behold that student

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
thought come

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
enough to leave that class discussion

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and this was a student who normally

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
would sit in the back of the room and

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
not be engaged and so the teacher told

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
me that story because she was really

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
happy about it but also she tried

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
something new she did a math lesson

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
about corn rolls and there's actually a

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
book it's called math as a verb and it

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
has a full lesson on just corn rolls and

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
there's of course other culturally

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
relevant lessons in there as well so The Framework

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
we're always trying to connect to our

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
students and so my colleagues and I

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
created or put forth a framework for

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
culturally relevant cognitively

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
demanding math tasks and what we did was

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
we started with the literature on

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
culturally relevant teaching and then we

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
added in the literature on cognitively

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
demanding tasks mary-kate Stein and her

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
colleagues helped us with that and from

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that we were able to come up with a

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
framework that could assist teachers in

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
making culturally relevant lessons and

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
so this is one of the tasks that

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
teachers create it and I loved it I

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
thought of the students I used to teach

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
right away because I thought of tagging

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and I thought of Christmas

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
graffiti but one of the things that the

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
teachers learned was that a task is not

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
culturally relevant in itself it depends

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
on the students so for me this was

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
culturally relevant for my students but

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for another colleague they didn't feel

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
it was culturally relevant at all and by

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the way this particular task gets at

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
domain and range it gets at graphing on

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
a coordinate plane it gets that ratio

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and proportion and using a scale factor

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
in order to reduce sorry reduce our or

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
enlarge the picture. Moving Forward

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
so how do we move forward so teachers

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
trying to find resources that would help

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
them to create culturally relevant

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
mathematics tasks they could look at Bob

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Moses he talks about math being a civil

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
rights issue and what he talked about

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
was how algebra has been a gatekeeper

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and how even in the car at the college

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
level how some students have to take

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
algebra two and three times in order to

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
graduate college so it is indeed still a

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
gatekeeper it keeps some students from

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
really reaching their goals and then we

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
have other people like Gloria

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ladson-billings who talked about

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
teachers that were successful with

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
african-american students and then we

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
talked about Peterson and guts teen or

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
gutes teens scuse excuse my

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
pronunciation who talked about math for

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
social justice and and they have a

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
lesson in their book called buying a

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
home while black or brown I love it it's

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
for high school students and they get to

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
read statistics about what is really

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
happening when people go out and

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
purchase try to purchase a home depends

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
on the neighborhood right and then

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
finally I have a math and culture and

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
popular media and I like that resource

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
by Chappell and Thompson excuse me

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I like that resource because it brings

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in popular media and so we can watch a

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
clip from a movie like The Pursuit of

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Happyness

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and she has lessons to go with that and

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
so how will you move forward and I and

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
this is what I say to you to move

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
forward this is what you want to do you

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
want to remember what cred Dotson says

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
he says in our classroom we don't teach

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
math we teach children just think about

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that we teach children we want to

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
empower them we want them to be

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
academically successful we want them to

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
be culturally competent and so we think

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
of all of these things

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and there was one slide that I want to

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
go back to because I do have one more

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
minute and I just wanted to say that we

265
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
also created a rubric to help teachers

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
assess the level of cultural relevance

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
so for instance in one of the

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
characteristics of a culturally relevant

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
tasks you have students will critique

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Society

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
well we don't do that very much in math

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and it's actually okay that we don't but

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
maybe we want to do it sometimes

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
or one of the one of the characteristics

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is that we use students knowledge in in

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
knowledge of their community and math

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
lessons and so these are some of the

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
tools that teachers can use to help them

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
create culturally relevant math tasks to

280
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
use culturally relevant math tasks and

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to engage students give them an entry

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
point into math because as we know math

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
is cultural thank you
