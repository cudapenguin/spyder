good evening and thank you to Jesse
0:10
Turner and John Foshay for inviting me
0:14
here tonight and I thank you all for
0:16
coming Experiment
0:20
math is cultural that's not a question
0:24
it just says let's do an experiment this
0:28
is the scenario I'm in otavalo Ecuador
0:32
and I don't speak Spanish and the vendor
0:35
doesn't speak English but I want six
0:38
oranges so I want everyone in the
0:41
audience to show me six with your
0:43
fingers hold them up in the air let's
0:47
see how you show six Wow look around see
0:51
the variety so we have six this way and
0:55
we have six this way and we even have
1:00
six this way
1:01
in Zulu you can put your hands down
1:04
in Zulu six literally means take the
1:08
thumb in Tanzania and Western and Rwanda
1:13
in Western Tanzania you might even see
1:16
six this way and I know some people had
1:19
this and they wondered yes I saw you a
1:22
okay as it turns out finger gestures are
1:28
very cultural in nature and if you think
1:32
about it counting is one of the most
1:34
basic things one of the most basic
1:37
mathematics activities that a culture
1:40
can do well today I'm going to talk
1:47
about culturally relevant pedagogy in
1:49
terms of mathematics right so culturally
1:53
relevant pedagogy teaching is a pedagogy
1:57
that empowers students and empowers them
2:02
intellectually socially emotionally and
2:07
politically and I really like that one
2:09
by using cultural reference to impart
2:13
knowledge skills and attitudes. Culturally Relevant Pedagogy
2:25
first of all students come to school to
2:29
learn we know that but we also know as
2:32
educators that what students learn in
2:36
the classroom is not all there is
2:39
Johanna Hayes our Teacher of the Year
2:42
and she's from Waterbury Connecticut she
2:47
really believes that it takes more than
2:49
what you do in the classroom and so I
2:52
agree with that and I think most
2:54
educators know that Gloria
2:58
ladson-billings says culturally relevant
3:02
teaching has three criteria one is is
3:06
that students have academic success so
3:10
it's not enough for the access we need
3:13
the attainment to that students have
3:17
cultural competence but let's face it we
3:20
are also hearing that teachers need
3:23
cultural competence as well and finally
3:27
that children develop a critical
3:30
consciousness we have to help students
3:33
and this is where the politically comes
3:35
in we have to help students understand
3:38
and be empowered to challenge the status
3:42
quo lots and billions goes on to say Social Context
3:48
that schools you sometimes often do not
3:54
really support culturally different
3:56
students because they don't provide a
4:00
social context for learning where
4:03
students can have access to the
4:05
knowledge and a comfortable in a
4:08
familiar way and we heard earlier in a
4:11
safe way so the question is can we teach. The Question
4:19
mathematics in a way that students can
4:23
connect to themselves and to their
4:26
communities and to their identity can we
4:30
teach in a way that empower students to
4:34
challenge injustice
4:38
and most of all can we teach in a way
4:40
that honors students and their cultural
4:46
and their intellectual greatness there's
4:49
a lot being said there so let's think
4:52
about this if we want to empower
4:54
students the task in our classroom have
5:00
to change right so the current
5:03
curriculum we have is just not gonna do
5:06
it oh I want to tell you about my young Real Life Stories
5:11
lady there so she participates in a
5:15
Saturday STEM program and I worked with
5:18
a group of students there to create
5:20
clocks for Benjamin Banneker day and
5:23
that particular day they were able to
5:25
use mathematics equations to go around
5:28
the hands of the clock and also just to
5:31
show their artistic side and she of
5:34
course is very artistic so Geneva gay
5:37
says that every student has a strength
5:42
every student does something well and
5:45
that's what we have to start with so
5:49
here are some real life stories if we
5:51
want to connect the students these are
5:53
some of the things that we could do
5:55
these are researchers that do that do
5:58
math for social justice and culturally
6:01
relevant math bill Tate worked with the
6:05
teacher to do a project with students to
6:09
sort of learn about their community and
6:11
what they wanted to do was to count the
6:15
number of liquor stores in their
6:18
neighborhood and they did that they took
6:20
a walk around their community and then
6:23
they took the bus to the suburban
6:25
community and they counted the number of
6:27
liquor stores or package stores if we
6:30
want to say it nicely in that
6:31
neighborhood and they found out to their
6:34
surprise that there were a lot more
6:36
liquor stores in their neighborhood and
6:39
so they wrote their City Council there's
6:41
the politically again right so when I
6:44
first started teaching I I didn't know
6:46
about that word politically I said
6:48
that's not my place but what I'm
6:50
learning is
6:51
that it is my place and so anyway these
6:54
students wrote a letter to their City
6:57
City Council and they asked to close 13
7:01
liquor stores that were in 1,000 feet of
7:05
their school how they know that they did
7:08
the research
7:08
so students are learning and they're
7:11
dealing with issues from their community
7:14
and they're using math they use
7:16
percentages decimals and fractions to
7:19
make their case to the City Council and
7:21
they were successful somewhat not
7:23
totally they didn't close 13 liquor
7:25
stores but they were somewhat successful
7:29
the other picture with the quilts a
7:31
Jacqueline Leonard and her colleagues
7:33
worked with fourth-grade teachers in
7:36
Philadelphia and they wanted to
7:39
incorporate culturally relevant teaching
7:42
and their reading and in their math
7:44
classroom and so what they did was they
7:47
made quilts so the students were able to
7:50
be artistic they were able to tell the
7:52
story because a quote tells the story
7:54
about your life so they were able to
7:56
talk about themselves and the teacher in
7:59
fact learned a lot about the students
8:01
that she didn't already know the other
8:03
thing is they learn area and perimeter
8:05
so we're still doing the math right when
8:09
Gloria ladson-billings said we have to
8:11
have academic success she didn't mean we
8:14
were going to do culturally relevant
8:16
math and dumb down the math we're still
8:19
gonna do math that is complex that gets
8:22
students thinking and also that sort of
8:26
hit the standards whatever those might
8:28
be because all teachers have to think
8:31
about that
8:32
the last picture shows corn rolls and I
8:35
had a colleague talk to me about a week
8:38
ago and she had a math lesson that she
8:41
wanted to do that involved corn rolls
8:43
and she has an african-american female
8:46
student in her classroom well she didn't
8:51
feel it was her place to just pick that
8:53
particular student out so she emailed
8:55
the whole class and said do you know
8:57
anyone that knows how to do corn rolls
8:59
and would they mind speaking to our
9:02
class low and behold that student
9:04
thought come
9:05
enough to leave that class discussion
9:07
and this was a student who normally
9:10
would sit in the back of the room and
9:12
not be engaged and so the teacher told
9:15
me that story because she was really
9:17
happy about it but also she tried
9:20
something new she did a math lesson
9:23
about corn rolls and there's actually a
9:24
book it's called math as a verb and it
9:27
has a full lesson on just corn rolls and
9:30
there's of course other culturally
9:33
relevant lessons in there as well so The Framework
9:41
we're always trying to connect to our
9:43
students and so my colleagues and I
9:47
created or put forth a framework for
9:50
culturally relevant cognitively
9:53
demanding math tasks and what we did was
9:57
we started with the literature on
10:00
culturally relevant teaching and then we
10:03
added in the literature on cognitively
10:06
demanding tasks mary-kate Stein and her
10:09
colleagues helped us with that and from
10:13
that we were able to come up with a
10:16
framework that could assist teachers in
10:18
making culturally relevant lessons and
10:23
so this is one of the tasks that
10:26
teachers create it and I loved it I
10:29
thought of the students I used to teach
10:32
right away because I thought of tagging
10:34
and I thought of Christmas
10:36
graffiti but one of the things that the
10:39
teachers learned was that a task is not
10:42
culturally relevant in itself it depends
10:46
on the students so for me this was
10:48
culturally relevant for my students but
10:51
for another colleague they didn't feel
10:53
it was culturally relevant at all and by
10:55
the way this particular task gets at
10:57
domain and range it gets at graphing on
11:01
a coordinate plane it gets that ratio
11:03
and proportion and using a scale factor
11:06
in order to reduce sorry reduce our or
11:12
enlarge the picture. Moving Forward
11:19
so how do we move forward so teachers
11:23
trying to find resources that would help
11:26
them to create culturally relevant
11:29
mathematics tasks they could look at Bob
11:32
Moses he talks about math being a civil
11:36
rights issue and what he talked about
11:38
was how algebra has been a gatekeeper
11:40
and how even in the car at the college
11:44
level how some students have to take
11:46
algebra two and three times in order to
11:48
graduate college so it is indeed still a
11:51
gatekeeper it keeps some students from
11:53
really reaching their goals and then we
11:56
have other people like Gloria
11:58
ladson-billings who talked about
12:01
teachers that were successful with
12:03
african-american students and then we
12:06
talked about Peterson and guts teen or
12:09
gutes teens scuse excuse my
12:11
pronunciation who talked about math for
12:13
social justice and and they have a
12:16
lesson in their book called buying a
12:18
home while black or brown I love it it's
12:22
for high school students and they get to
12:24
read statistics about what is really
12:26
happening when people go out and
12:28
purchase try to purchase a home depends
12:31
on the neighborhood right and then
12:34
finally I have a math and culture and
12:37
popular media and I like that resource
12:40
by Chappell and Thompson excuse me
12:47
I like that resource because it brings
12:48
in popular media and so we can watch a
12:51
clip from a movie like The Pursuit of
12:54
Happyness
12:54
and she has lessons to go with that and
12:58
so how will you move forward and I and
13:03
this is what I say to you to move
13:06
forward this is what you want to do you
13:07
want to remember what cred Dotson says
13:10
he says in our classroom we don't teach
13:13
math we teach children just think about
13:17
that we teach children we want to
13:20
empower them we want them to be
13:22
academically successful we want them to
13:25
be culturally competent and so we think
13:29
of all of these things
13:30
and there was one slide that I want to
13:34
go back to because I do have one more
13:36
minute and I just wanted to say that we
13:38
also created a rubric to help teachers
13:41
assess the level of cultural relevance
13:44
so for instance in one of the
13:47
characteristics of a culturally relevant
13:50
tasks you have students will critique
13:53
Society
13:54
well we don't do that very much in math
13:57
and it's actually okay that we don't but
14:00
maybe we want to do it sometimes
14:02
or one of the one of the characteristics
14:05
is that we use students knowledge in in
14:08
knowledge of their community and math
14:10
lessons and so these are some of the
14:13
tools that teachers can use to help them
14:16
create culturally relevant math tasks to
14:19
use culturally relevant math tasks and
14:21
to engage students give them an entry
14:24
point into math because as we know math
14:27
is cultural thank you
14:29
[Applause]
